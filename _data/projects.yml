  tagline: Simulation of L1, L2, and Main Memory Cache System
  tools: C
  description: |
    Implemented a simulator in C that will simulate and evaluate a memory system with two levels of cache memory and a main memory.
    The caches are write-allocate, write-back caches. Simulations ran 5 traces on 15 different cache configurations. Each trace
    is about a few billion instructions and total simulations took around 30 hours to run fully.

    A system that pulls "summoner" data from the popular online game, League of Legends, and creates a weeklong heatmap of when you play most.
    It maps out every hour of the day from Monday to Sunday, so a player's game time trends are averaged in a easy to read format.

    Making the Engineering Center at CU Boulder not a nightmare to navigate. Me and three other students collaborated and created an iOS and Andriod
    apps that map out the Engineering Center using the architecture blueprints. We incorporated many coding practices such as pair programming, Test
    Driven Development, Continuous Integration, and AutoDocumentation.

  description: |
    EZList is a mobile app mockup that will allow easier grocery shopping for all
    users. The basics of this app is to read/input in a shopping list, then based on
    different settings and preferences, the app will find different routes to stores that
    will minimalize the cost of the entire shopping list!
    This idea was presented at the Atlas Expo at CU Boulder, and received very high remarks
    and interests!

    Developed for showing the wordcount of a Markdown GitHub flavored file. It essentially

    a number that corresponds to the number of "true words" there are.
